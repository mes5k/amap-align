   A fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment program

AMAP is a novel algorithm for producing multiple sequence alignments. 
It utilizes posterior decoding, and a novel sequence-annealing alignment, 
instead of the traditional progressive alignment method.
It is the only alignment program that allows to control the sensitivity / specificity tradeoff.
In its default configuration, AMAP is tuned to maximize the expected Alignment Metric Accuracy (AMA) score - 
a new alignment accuracy measure, based on a metric for the multiple-alignment space, 
which integrates sensitivity and specificity into a single balanced measure.

AMA is defined as the fraction of correctly aligned residues (either to another residue or to a gap) out of
the total number of residues in all the sequences.

   Eilat, Israel, September 2006.

The current version of AMAP uses the PROBCONS 1.09 code base for some of the input/output procedures,
and for the calculation of posterior probabilities (see PROBCONS.README). Future releases might implement
the algorithm using a new independent code base.
